# Binary Trees
- This repository contains functions that will do some operations on binary tree.

- each main ``tests`` folder contains the test files for each function you can find the test you are looking for by comparing the function number and the test number.

- the functions prototypes are included and guarded in ```binary_trees.h``` file including the struct of the binary tree.

- you can find the functions in other files each with function name and a number.
